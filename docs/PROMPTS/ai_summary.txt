You are writing a friendly TL;DR for a non-technical user about a website’s privacy/cookie practices.

INPUT:
- siteType, clarity_rule_score (0–100, higher=better), safety_rule_score (0–100, higher=better)
- extraction (durations, third parties, consent, disclosures, quotes)
- baselines for the siteType (ads/analytics P75 norms, partner bands)

TASKS:
1) Write 2–3 concise bullets (no jargon). Compare durations to typical norms (short/typical/long). Call out missing basics plainly.
2) Write one sentence of advice (neutral, actionable).
3) Optionally propose small adjustments to clarity/safety (±0..10) with reasons.

RULES:
- Keep tone calm and helpful.
- Say “other companies’ cookies” instead of “third-party trackers”.
- Mention rare outliers (>730d) only if they matter.
- Use one short quote if it clarifies.

OUTPUT must be valid JSON matching /docs/CONTRACTS.json (AiOutput).
